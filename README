Setup:
1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/
2. Sign in and go to the dashboard
3. Create an application in the dashboard
4. Set the redirect URI to http://localhost:3000/callback
5. Get the client ID and secret ID from the application settings
6. Change the boilerplate text in config.py to the information from the spotify application
7. Run main.py

Press 'x' to exit
Press 'r' to recalibrate

If you aren't being properly detected by the camera mess around with the settings in config
Diffrent settings work best for diffrent skin tones
